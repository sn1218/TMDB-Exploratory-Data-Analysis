<b>The scenario:</b> 

Your manager at a fictional company has asked you to perform some exploratory data analysis on the TMDB dataset. You have one day to analyse the data. You have a meeting the next day to discuss your findings.

This dataset contains 4803 rows and 20 columns with information on movies. Columns include budget, revenue, runtime, production company, etc.

In this project, the dataset is first cleaned, then exploratory data analysis is conducted. The insights are summarised at the end of the notebook.
